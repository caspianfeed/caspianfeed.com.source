description: Like most farm animals, such as pigs, sheep, ducks and bees black soldier flies require the most amount of attention during breeding, hatching and first few days of their life as larvae. Once they get to 5 day old larvae they are like weaner pigs. Anyone with a little bit of effort can raise them. That is why we are positioning our company to be a black soldier fly breeder in Canada and we sell BSF as 5DOL. We realized that by taking on the hard part of operation and mastering it, we can enable many other farmers and producers to enjoy the benefits of black soldier flies.
