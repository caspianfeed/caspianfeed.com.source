description: In Canada, rearing 5DOL can be done in an insulated container for year round production, or it could be done in a seasonal manner inside a temporary structure such as a tent. If space is limited, bins can be stacked to maximize use of space. Depending on what kind of organic materials you plan to use, we can customize the design of your rearing facility to better handle your input. For example, the design of a rearing facility for processing cow manure on a dairy farm would be very different from an organic vegetable farm with seasonal waste. We can provide you with a continuous supply of larvae to fuel your system.
